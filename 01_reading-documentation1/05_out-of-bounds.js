// What happens if we take the array ['fish', 'and', 'chips'] and try to access the element at index position 10? Try this in your JavaScript console.

// When we try to access an element that doesn't exist in the array, that it doesn't have an index,
// the result will be undefined. JavaScript will not raise an exception.

console.log(['fish', 'and', 'chips'][10]);
